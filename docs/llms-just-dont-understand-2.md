# LLMs Just Don't Understand

I agree with Grady's [tweet](https://twitter.com/Grady_Booch/status/1679767930748432385):

But I also understand (at least I think, I think I do), that it's difficult to describe the subtleties of LLMs and their capabilities at language manipulation and automation without resorting to anthropomorphism at times.

So, I decided to manipulate some tokens using my [word calculator](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Apr/2/calculator-for-words/) to come up with some alternative terms:

Here is the information organized into a Markdown table:

| Concept          | LLM Capability                                                                                                 | Alternate Terminology     |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Hallucinations   | Produces outputs that don't align with established reality, creating novel or unusual responses.               | Novelty Creation          |
| Reasoning        | Provides outputs that follow a logical structure based on the context of the input.                            | Logic Simulation          |
| Understanding    | Generates contextually relevant outputs by processing the semantic structure of the input.                     | Contextual Response       |
| Learning         | Produces new responses by applying patterns acquired during training.                                          | Pattern Use               |
| Memory           | Uses information embedded in training data to generate responses that seem contextually appropriate.           | Data Recall               |
| Judgement        | Produces outputs that appear to evaluate or weigh different factors or options.                                | Evaluation Simulation     |
| Decision-making  | Selects the most fitting output from a range of possibilities based on the input.                              | Optimal Selection         |
| Reading          | Processes and understands the structure and semantics of written language.                                     | Text Interpretation       |
| Writing          | Produces written content that follows grammatical rules and matches the context of the input.                  | Text Production           |
| Imagination      | Generates narratives or scenarios that extend beyond the given input.                                          | Scenario Creation         |
| Thinking         | Generates outputs that seem to display a thought process, achieved by pattern matching based on training data. | Simulated Thought Process |
| Translation      | Converts a piece of text from one language to another, maintaining the meaning and context.                    | Language Conversion       |
| Listening        | In the context of voice recognition software, transcribes spoken language into written text.                   | Audio Transcription       |
| Speaking         | In the context of text-to-speech software, converts written text into spoken language.                         | Speech Synthesis          |

Would you like to add or modify any entries in this table?


I honestly don't like them because they are clunky and hard to remember.

But I now have a blog article to point to when I see smart people arguing over definitions.
