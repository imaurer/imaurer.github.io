# About Ian Maurer

I'm the Chief Technology Officer at [GenomOncology](https://genomoncology.com/), a precision oncology startup based in Cleveland, Ohio. I focus on building AI-powered systems that help oncologists make better treatment decisions using genomic data.

## Background

My career spans software engineering, data science, and biotechnology. I'm passionate about the intersection of artificial intelligence and genomics, particularly how AI can accelerate medical discoveries and improve patient outcomes.

At GenomOncology, I lead the development of platforms that analyze genomic variants and connect them to therapeutic insights, helping oncologists understand complex molecular data and translate it into actionable treatment recommendations.

## Writing Philosophy

I write about the practical applications of emerging technologies, particularly AI and genomics. My posts tend to focus on:

- Real-world implementations rather than theoretical concepts
- The intersection of AI and domain-specific knowledge
- Developer tools and productivity enhancements
- The human elements that remain crucial as AI capabilities expand

I believe that the most interesting technological advances happen at the intersection of disciplines - where AI meets biology, where developer tools meet domain expertise, and where theoretical capabilities meet practical constraints.
